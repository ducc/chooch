# chooch

Downloads files fast (in theory).

You shouldn't use this, it's not robust and it will probably corrupt your files.

It was created in haste in attempt to download large files from servers across the internet, where single TCP streams are probably slower than many.

```bash
chooch [URL] [OUTPUT_PATH]
```
